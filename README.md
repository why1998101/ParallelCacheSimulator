## Multi-Core Cache Simulator with Different Cache Coherence Protocols

###### by Zhuoyu Ji (zhuoyuj) and Haoyang Wang (haoyang4)

#### We build a multi-core cache simulator which supports MESI, MESIF, and MOESI cache coherence protocols. We perform experiments using the cache simulator to investigate how different protocols perform under different use patterns.
