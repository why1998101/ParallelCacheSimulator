### Parallel Cache Simulator 

##### by Zhuoyu Ji (zhuoyuj) and Haoyang Wang (haoyang4)

#### We build a parallel cache simulator which supports snooping-based MESI, MESIF, and MOESI cache coherence schemes. We do experiments using the cache simulator to investigate how different schemes perform under different use patterns.
